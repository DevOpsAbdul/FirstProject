# 🌐 My First GitHub DevOps Project

This project is where I applied my first weeks of DevOps learning into practice. I built a **simple static HTML website** and deployed it using **Docker** and **Nginx**.

The goal was to get hands-on experience with containerization, reproducible environments, and basic deployment workflows.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

* Create a static HTML website
* Serve it using **Nginx**
* Package the website in a **Docker container**
* Deploy locally with Docker Compose
* Learn Docker image building and container deployment

---

## 📁 Project Structure

```
FirstProject/
├── index.html          # Main static HTML page
├── Dockerfile          # Docker configuration for Nginx
├── docker-compose.yml  # Optional Compose setup for easy deployment
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps (My Process)

1️⃣ Built the Docker image for the project.

2️⃣ Ran the container locally and mapped port 80 to 8080.

3️⃣ Opened the website in a browser at `http://localhost:8080` to verify it was running successfully.

This workflow helped me understand the basics of containerized deployments.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

* The project uses the official `nginx:alpine` image.
* `index.html` is served by Nginx from its default web root.
* Docker ensures the environment is consistent and portable.
* Docker Compose can be used to manage the container more easily.

## 💡 What I Learned

* How Docker containers work and how to build them
* Using Nginx to serve static content
* The importance of reproducible and portable environments
* Basic local deployment workflow using Docker Compose

---

## 📌 Current Status

✅ HTML website deployed
✅ Docker container running successfully
✅ Nginx serving static content
✅ Docker Compose setup working

---

## 🧐 What are my next steps

* Add CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) for automatic builds
* Deploy to a cloud provider (AWS / Azure / GCP)
* Explore multi-container applications and networking
* Add monitoring and logging for container health
